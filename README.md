#A “Spotify” for workouts where users can follow, post their workouts, and track successes

Building a sample, production quality rails application that is a social network. Will reinforce my knowledge of the MVC design paradigm while using REST architecture.

The web application will have users, micro-posts, authentication, etc.

Authentication system is completed in house.


Future Changes:
-Remove Gravatar and use paperclip/AWS
-Sign-up for sendgrid so that production emails will send correctly for new user registration and password resets
